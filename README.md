The program implements part of speech tagger using following algorithms and compares their accuracy for each sentence:
1. Naive inference
2. Sampling (Gibbs)
3. Approximate max-marginal inference
4. Exact maximum a posteriori inference (Viterbi)
5. Voting based approach

Commandline: python label.py train_file test_file
